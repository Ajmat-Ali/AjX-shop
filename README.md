# AjX-Shop 🛒

AjX-Shop is a **frontend-only e-commerce application** built for learning and practicing real-world frontend concepts using **React** and modern tooling. The project uses **FakeStore API** to display mock products and gradually evolves with features like filtering, sorting, cart, wishlist, and single product pages.

This README acts as a **living document**. As new features are added or architecture changes, this file should be updated accordingly.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Practice **real-world React patterns**
- Understand **component-based architecture**
- Implement **frontend-only e-commerce logic** (no backend)
- Improve skills in **state management, routing, UI, and UX**
- Prepare a solid foundation for **full-stack freelancing projects**

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **React** – UI library
- **React DOM** – DOM rendering
- **React Router DOM** – Client-side routing
- **Parcel** – Bundler
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
- **FakeStore API** – Fake product data source

- Avoid prop drilling where possible
- Prefer **derived state** over duplicated state
- Keep logic in `utils/` and UI in `components/`
- Update this README whenever:
  - A new feature is added
  - Folder structure changes
  - Tech stack changes
